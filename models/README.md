The DAVE2 model used for our training process is stored here, with different variations. We have used the DAVE2V3 class for our training. If you want to use different models (say ResNet or VAE), you can create their architecture and store it as Python files in this directory

Note: Ensure that the __init__.py file is a part of your ``/models`` directory. This is to ensure that your training code recognizes it as a valid directory to import your model file from.
